# API-using-Google-Sheets

- In this mini-project, I have built a website that hosts data directly from Major League Hacking's [Events Page](https://mlh.io/seasons/2024/events). 
* The data used in the website like the Events Name, Date, Location, Image and Events Link are all derived from Google Sheets.

## Why Google Sheets? 
### Why not use a database or and API framework or MS Excel?
1. The main goal is to build a _consumable API_ for anyone in the world to use. 
2. A database is ultimately a collection of tables that consists of rows and columns. 
3. You can have multiple sheets in a single spreadsheet using Google Sheets. It is eventually resembles a relational data base.
4. **Google App Scripts**
_Google has a free runtime that allows anyone to write and run custom scripts on Google products like Google Sheets. 
5. **It's free when working on personal projects like these**
